# https://makefiletutorial.com/
# A Makefile consists of a set of rules. A rule generally looks like this:
# 
# targets : prerequisites
#    command
#    command
#    command

# Adding .PHONY to a target will prevent make from confusing the phony target with a file name. 
# For example, if the file “clean” is created somehow elsewhere, "make clean" will still be run.
.PHONY: all tiflibs rbuildcleanup

all: $(SHLIB) rbuildcleanup

$(SHLIB): tiflibs

# Note that each command is run independently, that's why there is a "cd" in each one.
tiflibs:
	cd tiff410/r_build && cmake --clean-first ../
	cd tiff410/r_build && make all -j4 -B
	cd tiff410/r_build && cmake --target clean ../

# The cleanup target must depend on the rest in order to be execured last in a parallel compilation
rbuildcleanup: $(SHLIB)
	rm -rf tiff410/r_build/*
