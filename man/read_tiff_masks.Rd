\title{Read cellID masks from BF.out TIFF image}
\usage{
read_tiff_masks(
  path,
  cell_id_offset = -1,
  interior_offset = NULL,
  blank_bg = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{A string. The path to the 16-bit BF.out tiff file to read.}

\item{cell_id_offset}{the offset with respect to maximum pixel intensity, such
that \code{cellID = maximum_intensity - boundary_intensity + cell_id_offset}.}

\item{interior_offset}{logical. If \code{TRUE} the function expects that
cell masks have interior pixels offset from boundary pixels.}

\item{blank_bg}{logical. If \code{TRUE} the function assumes that the image
background (i.e., non-mask pixels) are blank.}
}
\value{
A data frame.
}
\description{
Read boundary and interior pixel data from a BF.out TIFF image.
}
\details{
Reads cell masks from 16-bit BF.out images into which boundary and interior
pixels are encoded as intensity values proportional to the cellID.

By default the function accounts for the possibility that that the image
may have a brightfield image background, and/or interior pixel
intensities offset from boundary pixels. This behavior can be overridden
by the user by explicitly defining the image type via the \code{blank_bg} and
\code{interior_offset} parameters, which may speed up running time.
