Description: Analyse cellID data in the tidyverse framework. This package
    also has utility functions to generate, filter and preview data from
    fluorescence microscopy experiments (and maybe general cell
    cytometry).  Included are the tools to process CellID output (from
    tidyCell). Also, rcell2 interfaces directly with two other packages.
    The rcell2.cellid package bundles the CellID program source, and wraps
    it in a single R function. The rcell2.magick package offers R-Shiny
    apps and magick-based functions to help users preview cell images and
    filter data graphically.  This group of packages is meant to succeed
    the older RCell package.
