## For every combination of two pixels on the boundary, Cell-ID calculates
## the distance along the boundary path divided by the Euclidean distance
## between them. The maximum value of this ratio was larger for cells with
## a “figure-eight” shape that were pinched in some part than for circular cells.
## If the maximum value was above a user-defined threshold (which defaulted to 6), 
## then we  split the cell into two cells at the location of the pinch
## However, iff the Euclidean distance divided by the length of the minor axis was
## greater than a user-defined value (which defaulted to 0.5), for either of the
## new cells, then the two cells were re-grouped as a single cell. Thus, we 
## required that the two new cells had a generally circular shape and were 
## not too elongated, as would be the case if the previous split was not over
## two cell, but over a cell and its mating projection.

## The code makes an initial decision about the graylevels of the
## boundary pixels. To do this it takes the mean position of all the
## graylevels in the images and subtracts Z standard deviations. It then
## starts by considering all gray levels below this value as being
## parts of the cell borders. This value Z is the parameter
## background_reject_factor. Brightfield images taken slightly out of
## focus may do better with with higher values (ie, higher values will
## better avoid spurious cells), but if the cell boundaries in the image
## are too narrow, a smaller value may be necessary--which might increase
## the level of background.
 background_reject_factor 1.5


## Calculate all the fluorescence images variables on the bright field
## image as if it were a fluorescence image. This is potentially a good
## idea since it allows a good way to reject spurious cells. For example,
## the average value of the boundary pixels in good cells will be lower
## than the background level, but not so for spurious cells, etc.

## "bf_fl_mapping" option description (by guesswork, mask_mod branch).
## The mapping between brightfield and fluorescence images can be made
## by acquisition time, or derived from the order in the list of paths
## passed as command line options "-b" and "-f" to cell.
## If the order is by "list", then the paths must be grouped and ordered
## first by t.frame (ascending) and then by channel.
## If the order is by "time", cell derives the BF-FL mapping from the
## acquisition time in the TIFF metadata.

## If we have a "fret" image or not (a "fret" image here means that
## the image is split into an upper and lower half, each with its own
## excitation filter in front of it).
## The three arguments (bf_top_only, bf_bottom_only, bf_bottom_and_top)
## indicate where in the bright field image to look for the cells--since
## it's assumed that the bright field image also had its output sent
## throught the two excitation filters.

## More for the fret images. One of the fluorescence images will be
## used to identify the nucleus. Should it be the top or bottom image.

## If there is a third image type included, then this describes how
## to use it (nuclear_label means its a fluorescence tagged nucleus
## channel, vacuole_label means vacuole label)

## "do_recombination" to try to connect cells using cuts on fluorescence
## "recombination_fl_per_a_nucleus F CUT" is cut below which we consider the
## cell has no nucleus. "F" is the "flag" given to the fluorescence type we're
## going to use for the cut.
## "recombination_is_a_cell_fl_per_a F CUT" is minimum fluorescence/area to
## consider the cell a real cell (a way to get rid of junk). This is only
## used for recombining cells. Ie, for recombining cells we only consider
## cells above CUT but we don't throw away those that fail. "F" is the flag
## for the fluorescence type to use.
